## 2.1.0 (2018-07-17)

**NOTE**: This version requires a change to the on-disk format.  After
installing the new version restarting PostgreSQL, any previously accumulated
statistics will be reset.

  - Add support for architecture that don't provide getrusage(2), such as
    windows.  Only user time and system time will be available on such
    platforms (Julien Rouhaud).
  - Expose more fields of getrusage(2).  Depending on the platform, some of
    these fields are not maintained (Julien Rouhaud).
  - Add a workaround for sampling problems with getrusage(), new parameter
    pg_stat_kcache.linux_hz is added.  By default, this parameter is discovered
    at server startup (Ronan Dunklau).
  - Add compatibility with PostgreSQL 11 (Thomas Reiss)
  - Fix issue when concurrently created entries for the same user, db and
    queryid could lost some execution counters (Mael Rimbault)

    BACQ for the report)

    prevent starting postgres
